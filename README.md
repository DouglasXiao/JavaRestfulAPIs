# JavaRestfulAPIs
The system is responsible for scheduling medical appointments over the internet. In order to do so it exposes a RESTful API that allows you to get a list of available slots for a given day, request a slot to be reserved and cancel a reserved slot.Â  All calls are made with a valid token id given previously to the client by other part of the system not relevant to this piece.
